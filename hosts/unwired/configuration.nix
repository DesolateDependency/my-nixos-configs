  # This value does NOT affect the Nixpkgs version your packages and OS are pulled from,

  # to actually do that.

  # This value being lower than the current NixOS release does NOT mean your system is

  # Do NOT change this value unless you have manually inspected all the changes it would make to your configuration,
  # and migrated your data accordingly.
